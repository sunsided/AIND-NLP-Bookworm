        <h2>by Frank Herbert</h2>
        <p>
            A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct.<br />
            This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib,<br/>
            then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor,<br/>
            Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis.<br/>
            Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there.<br/>
            Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.
